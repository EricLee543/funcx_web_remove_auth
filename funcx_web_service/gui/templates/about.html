                    This will be an introduction to funcX. It will mostly (or somehow) summarize the video and very briefly introduce funcX and the idea. funcX is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform for science that enables you to convert almost any resource into a high-performance function serving device. Deploying a funcX endpoint will integrate your resource into the function serving fabric, allowing you to dynamically send, monitor, and receive results from function invocations. funcX is underpinned by Parsl, allowing you to connect your endpoint to large compute resources via traditional batch queues, where funcX will dynamically provision, use, and release resources on-demand to fulfill function requests.

                    Parsl is a Python library for programming and executing data-oriented workflows (dataflows) in parallel. Parsl scripts allow selected Python functions and external applications (called apps) to be connected by shared input/output data objects into flexible parallel workflows. Rather than explicitly defining a dependency graph and/or modifying data structures, instead developers simply annotate Python functions and Parsl constructs a dynamic, parallel execution graph derived from the implicit linkage between apps based on shared input/output data objects. Parsl then executes apps when dependencies are met. Parsl is resource-independent, that is, the same Parsl script can be executed on a laptop, cluster, cloud, or supercomputer.

                    funcX is built on from Parsl for the interaction with endpoints. Something about how funcX uses Parsl and how it is important for users. oautouah oah;o eoia ouahgo; hSOih iug ieEOIHO OIOehoH OIHOIHOIHIOoiahoiaho oihoaogi iu oaih paeroigh posj kbkg apojgoi iohg oirig aigj oa;ifhg oiapouagpo apoguoeu ooihoaihro; nbpdjb pai o

                    Something about the objectives of funcX, basically a short summary of the video or something else related to the video. Or something about why the idea of funcX is generated, more about "why funcX".
